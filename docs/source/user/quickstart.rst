Introduction

.. currentmodule:: openpiv_cxx

.. testsetup::

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> import openpiv_cxx

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need to know a little bit of Python. 

To work the examples, you will need ``numpy``, ``imageio``, and ``matplotlib`` installed
in addition to this package.

Load images
===========

There are several way to load images, however the one we would be using the image loader from our package.

**Learner profile**

This is a quick overview of arrays in NumPy. It demonstrates how n-dimensional
(:math:`n>=2`) arrays are represented and can be manipulated. In particular, if
you don't know how to apply common functions to n-dimensional arrays (without
using for-loops), or if you want to understand axis and shape properties for
n-dimensional arrays, this article might be of help.

**Learning Objectives**

After reading, you should be able to:

- Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in
  NumPy;
- Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional
  arrays without using for-loops;
- Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.
